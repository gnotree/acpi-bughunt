# ACPI Namespace Collision Research

Research repository documenting reproducible ACPI namespace collisions observed
on a Lenovo platform.

The firmware exposes duplicate ACPI namespace objects which cause
ACPICA interpreter errors (AE_ALREADY_EXISTS) and abort certain hardware
methods during boot.

Current classification: firmware correctness defect with possible security relevance.

No privilege escalation or memory corruption has been demonstrated.

Contents:
- ACPI dumps
- DSL disassembly
- kernel logs
- reproduction steps
